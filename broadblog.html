      <h2>IG Clone</h2>
      <p>Today's idea is to develop an instagram clone and incorporate NFC functionality so it can stand out, mostly as a fun idea but eventually, a potential pitch. I've spoken with two people about the idea, and both have no idea why it hasn't been done yet. Gonna put my head down and start learning how to build an Instagram clone. </p>
      <p>Cheers,</p>
